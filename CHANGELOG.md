## v2.2.11
06-11-2023  
[main] (@webdevnerdstuff)
* Changing Highlight.js to include all languages by default.
  * Unfortunately, adding additional languages was not working as expected, so this is the best solution I can think of for now.
* Updated typings for Props as well as composables.
* Changing compiling to use a Vite config instead of rollup so d.ts file aliases resolve correctly.

## v2.1.1
04-16-2023  
[main] (@webdevnerdstuff)
* Changing importing of css/scss/sass to use @use instead of @import.

## v2.1.0
04-16-2023
[main] (@webdevnerdstuff)
* Changing component to use the min version of the default themes.
* Reorganizing default themes to new location.
  * This is a breaking change if you are importing the default themes from the `node_modules` folder. You will need to update your import paths to the new location.
  * If you are using the default themes without using `import` then you will not be affected by this change.
* Fixing HighlightJS default theme style causing icon to appear over a scrollbar when present.
* Adding sass scripts to package.json to compile scss files to css.
